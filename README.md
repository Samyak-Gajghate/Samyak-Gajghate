## 🚀 Selected Projects
**IVSS — Intelligent Video Surveillance System**

- **What**: Multi-camera AI surveillance pipeline combining YOLOv8, DLIB face recognition, motion detection, and a Flask + PostgreSQL dashboard.
- **Impact**: Achieved ~86.7% weapon-detection accuracy and 95%+ face recognition precision; processed 30 FPS across 8+ feeds with sub-second alerts while reducing false positives substantially.
- **Tech**: Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, DLIB, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy. 

**Job Board Platform**

- **What**: Modern job board with AI matching, secure auth, email alerts, and a type-safe database layer.
- **Impact**: Designed for scale (10k+ postings) and improved engagement with automated AI matching & notifications.
- **Tech**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Clerk, AI APIs (Claude & Gemini), Resend. 

## 💡 What I enjoy working on

- Real-time computer vision systems and low-latency inference pipelines

- End-to-end ML productization (models → APIs → dashboards → alerts)

- Building developer-friendly backends and type-safe data layers

- Mentoring peers & leading cross-functional student projects

## 📂 GitHub highlights

- Public repositories: 3 · Stars: 6 (as shown on my profile). 
GitHub

- I maintain personal and learning projects; I also fork and contribute to community repos (e.g., first-bit, alumni).
